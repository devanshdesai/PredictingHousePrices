# PredictingHousePrices
Final project for STAT 1291: Statistics &amp; Data Science

### To-Do for 03/19
* Find predictors that have a small number of examples and eliminate them (ex. only one house has a pool, we can get rid of the pool variable)
* Try different things with the rows that have missing data - impute the most frequent category for missing categorical data/eliminate rows that have missing data
* Try random forests, boosting, ensemble methods


### John To-Do for Next Meeting:
* Use the processed data that Kevin made
* Model the data using Lasso, Ridge Regression, KNN, and other models you can think of
* Get the MSEs and try to optimize the models
* Try to make a graph of the MSEs vs model like we did in the hwk
* Make sure you push your code and results to GitHub

### Lauren To-Do for Next Meeting:
* Use the processed data that Kevin made
* Model the data using multiple regression using forward and backward selection, PCR, PLS, and other models you can think of
* Try to find a good amount of variables to use
* Get the MSEs and try to optimize the models
* Try to make a graph of the MSEs vs model like we did in the hwk
* Make sure you push your code and results to GitHub
