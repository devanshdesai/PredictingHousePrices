# PredictingHousePrices
Final project for STAT 1291: Statistics &amp; Data Science

### To Do
* Find predictors that have a small number of examples and eliminate them (ex. only one house has a pool, we can get rid of the pool variable)
* Try different things with the rows that have missing data - impute the most frequent category for missing categorical data/eliminate rows that have missing data
* Try random forests, boosting, ensemble methods
