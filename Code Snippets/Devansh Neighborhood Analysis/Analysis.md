# Neighborhood Analysis
### Devansh Desai

I aggregated the following variables by each of the neighborhoods and averaged them per neighborhood:
    * BedroomAbvGr
    * Fireplaces
    * GarageCars
    * LotArea
    * OverallQual
    * SalePrice
    * TotalBath
    * TotalSF
    * YearBuilt
    
Then, I ordered the neighborhoods by their average SalePrice in ascending order and plotted all the variables vs their neighborhoods.
The results were pretty surprising. The discrepency between the wealthy and poor neighborhoods in the town is pretty large. The correlations
for each of the variables and the average SalePrice by neighborhood were all very high, showing a strong linear relationship. Some variables
such as BedroomAbvGr didn't show too much of a relationship but some such as TotalSF, OverallQual, and GarageCars showed a very strong relationship.
