## Notes
* We dummy coded all of the variables we could into "test_processed.csv" and "train_processed.csv"
* We're now going to remove extraneous categories that aren't used that many times as their effect won't be significant on the prediction
* More changes to the variables:
    * Continue dummy coding the variables that need to have a scale (Kevin)
    * PoolArea - Remove
    * MiscFeature - Remove (only keep MiscVal)
    *
* NOTE: We will need to try regression imputation (single or multiple imputation) for the missing values in the data. Currently, we are just replacing the missing values with either the average or 0 (currently deciding that at the moment).
