## Notes
* We dummy coded all of the variables we could into "test_processed.csv" and "train_processed.csv"
* "trainy_processed.csv" has the same data as "train_processed.csv" but with the response y added in
* We're now going to remove extraneous categories that aren't used that many times as their effect won't be significant on the prediction
* More changes to the variables:
    * Continue dummy coding the variables that need to have a scale (Kevin)
    * PoolArea - Remove
    * MiscFeature - Remove (only keep MiscVal)
    * Exterior1st / Exterior2nd - If Exterior1 == Exterior2nd, set Exterior2nd to NA. Then, use dummy code and use 1s and 0s to indicate which type of exterior covering houses use (houses with 2 types of coverings will have 2 1s in the dummy coded columns)
    * MasVnrType - Remove CBlock dummy variable as no house in the training or testing data uses that
    * Basement variables - Still need to figure out (we'll do that next meeting)

* NOTE: We will need to try regression imputation (single or multiple imputation) for the missing values in the data. Currently, we are just replacing the missing values with either the average or 0 (currently deciding that at the moment).
* Possible future changes to variables:
    * Sum all porch SF variables into one total porch SF variable
    * LandContour / LandSlope - We can use what we have now but in the future we can remove the most common category
        * Lots of houses have the same category (Gentle slope / level)
        * Removing the most common categories sort of sets a baseline of a home
    * YearRemodAdd - Potentially after we get a few models done, we can create a new variable which says how many years ago the remodel was done
    * RoofMatl - We can use what we have now but in the future we can remove the most common category
    * PavedDrive - Possibly just change this to 1 or 0 for paved or unpaved
        * We could either group partial paved (P) with not paved (N) or paved (Y)
