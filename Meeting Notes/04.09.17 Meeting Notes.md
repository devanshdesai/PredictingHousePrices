* Additional analysis topics:
    * Devansh: Analysis on the different neighborhoods across the dataset and comparing rich vs poor neighborhoods. I'm comparing different variables such as bathrooms, fireplaces, sq foot, etc.
    * Lauren: Will create a variable X that is SalePrice/SqFeet. Then, she will find the average X value across the dataset grouped by month. That way, we can see when the best time of year is to buy a house in Iowa.

*  Each of us will write an extensive paragraph describing all of the things we did for our models. This MUST includes Kaggle scores, specific tuning parameters (if the models had them), and conclusions about your model.
    * Talk about whether our models are consistent or inconsistent (do they always perform the same on multiple runs of your program)
    * The best variables involved in your models (provide a ranking by importance)

* Make sure you pick your interesting fact AND the paragraph for your models TONIGHT 04/09 as we all need to write our papers
