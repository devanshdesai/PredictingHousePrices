    * Resolution: We're dummy coding these
* Condition1 / Condition2 - Dummy code categories with 0s and 1s
* BldgType - Dummy code categories with 0s and 1s
* HouseStyle - Dummy code categories with 0s and 1s
* YearRemodAdd - Talk to professor (some houses aren't remodeled but have the YearBuilt date listed)
