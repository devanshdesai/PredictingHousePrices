## Notes
* Devansh, Kevin and Lauren got Kaggle scores for their respective models
* We created plots and recorded all of our Kaggle scores using different tuning parameters (such as mtry for random forests)
* Lauren completed PLS and PCR and retrieved predictions and scores for both models. She still has forward and backward selection left
* Devansh completed random forests, bagging, and boosting with various tuning parameters
* Kevin completed a single decision tree with different tree pruning parameters
* John still needs to complete his assignment
* Weston's assignment was boosting but I (Devansh) did that for the homework and got a good score on Kaggle
